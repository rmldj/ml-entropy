# Instructions for reproducing results

## NOT, OR, AND, XOR dataset results

The data in Table 1 is in `dependence_nf_50.log` generated by
```
python dependence.py 50
```

## The 2D Ising model

### Exact solution

`entropies20.txt`, `freeenergies20.txt` contain exact results for 20x20 Ising model for T=1.0 to T=4.0 at 0.1 intervals. These files were generated by the *Mathematica* notebook `exact_finite_size_ising.nb`.

### Ising Monte Carlo data

See `README.md` in `data_paper` folder.

### Ising model results

The data for Tables 2-5 is contained in the files:

* `hyper.log` (Table 2)
* `n.log` (Table 3)
* `cv.log` (Table 4)
* `order.log` (Table 5)

These data are generated by the script `experiments.sh` (takes quite some time...).

The linear extrapolation of Table 3 is done in the *Mathematica* notebook `linear_extrapolation_in_n.nb`. 

The predictions for the range of temperatures T=1.0 to T=4.0 are in `scan50.log` and `scan50augment.log`. These files are generated by
```
python scan50.py
python scan50augment.py
```
This takes a lot of time (especially the augmented version). Only the T=1.0 point is significantly different between the two versions.

The plots are generated by
```
python ising_plots.py
```
using `scan50.log`, `scan50augment.log` and the exact results.
